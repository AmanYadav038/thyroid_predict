THYROID_PREDICTOR
==================

A web-based intelligent system to predict thyroid conditions using machine learning and evolutionary algorithms. The project is powered by a Random Forest classifier trained on features selected via a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Built using Flask for the backend and a simple HTML frontend, this app allows users to select symptoms and receive predictions dynamically.
